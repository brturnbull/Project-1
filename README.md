1. Brief explanation

2. instructions
  The game is set to a 30 second timer so the aim is essentially score as many points as possible within this time frame.
  The player, directs the sloth to the left and right of the screen to 'catch' the burgers falling from the sky. Each burger is 10 points added to the players total score.
  The player needs to avoid the carrots, however, as they detract 5 points from the score.
  When the time is up, the score is logged and the top 5 scores recorded are displayed on the leaderboard.
